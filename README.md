NOTE FOR FULL DISCLOSURE: One of the features, namely the Playground loader, utilizes the XML parser found in the Toontown Rewritten 2014 Source Code. This is to provide the end-user with areas most authentic to the game. I hope that the potential benefits of this entire tool for the Content Pack community outweight any potential negatives.

FAQ:
"What are the empty buttons whenever I generate props in the Prop GUI?" 
- A good chunk of them are animation files! 

"How do I get Content Pack support?"
- Make a folder called "multifiles"
- Put in any multifiles you have, and press the "Reload Packs" button in the Options Menu to generate them inside the Options.
